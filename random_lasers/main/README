#### Network Lasers

Sequence to generate the network laser samples and calculate the spectrum:
- 01_generation_graph.sh, random network generation in folders sample_001, sample_002, etc.
- 02_script_copy.sh, script copying into the folders
- 03_mat_gen.sh, initial analytical calculations
- 04_rl_sequence_gold.sh, numerical calculation of spectrum
(final result example in "sample_example" folder)

In the "plot_single_sample" folder some tools to plot properties of a given network laser sample.

The "stat.jl" script is to the statistical analysis over several network laser samples.


# Network Lasers

This repository contains scripts to generate and analyze network laser samples.

## Workflow

Sequence to generate the samples and calculate the spectrum:
1. **01_generation_graph.sh** – Random network generation in folders `sample_001`, `sample_002`, etc.
2. **02_script_copy.sh** – Copying the necessary scripts into the folders
3. **03_mat_gen.sh** – Initial analytical calculations
4. **04_rl_sequence_gold.sh** – Numerical calculation of the spectrum

Final results for an example of network laser sample can be found in the folder `sample_example`.

## Plotting

In the `plot_single_sample` folder, there are tools to plot the properties of a given network laser sample.

## Statistical Analysis

The script `stat.jl` performs statistical analysis over several network laser samples.
